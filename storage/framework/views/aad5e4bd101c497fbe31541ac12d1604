					<h3>Some words about us</h3>
					<span class="delimiter"></span>
					<p>We are assistant in information society. On any field of business, a successful company depends on customer’s satisfaction and their reactions to company’s product. With Chiroro – a computer service company, we are supporter for customer’s successful on using our product. Take a footstep backward to reach the goal in further, we decide to stand behind our customer, to work behind the scene.</p>
					<p>We are proudly established by a Japanese company who follows strictly a Japanese famous and traditional precept in commercial industry “Sanpou-Yoshi”. The word ‘Sanpou’, which was used by a superior merchant at Edo time (1603-1868), includes seller, customer and society; while ‘Yoshi’ is the same meaning to ‘good’.</p>
					<p>With this valuable business concept, our goal is to bring the best thing to our customer in Viet Nam. Therefore, Mr.KYUMA ANDO (Chiroro-Net's president in Japan) decided to establish the Chiroro-Net Viet company with 100% investment from Chiroro-Net Japan.</p>
